/**
 * A set of custom rules that allow for additional match tweaking beyond the additive model used
 * in PoiPolygonMatch.
 *
 * Originally, this class was used to reduce unnecessary reviews only and had several custom rules.
 * It was successful at doing that without introducing incorrect matches when running PoiPolygon
 * conflation in isolation, but when combined with other conflation types, errors were introduced.
 * The remaining rules are very specific and only have a small impact on the test data we've used
 * so far.  Therefore, this class is disabled by default.  Its left intact, though, in case a
 * situation is ever encountered where a custom rule could benefit the conflation of a particualar
 * dataset.  In the case that this happens, moving this logic into hoot-js might end up making more
 * sense.
